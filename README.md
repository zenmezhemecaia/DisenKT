Official implementation of the paper **"DisenKT: A Variational Attention-Based Approach for Disentangled Cross-Domain Knowledge Tracing"**

## Overview

DisenKT is a novel framework for cross-domain knowledge tracing that:
- Disentangles student knowledge states into domain-shared and domain-exclusive components
- Uses Variational Attention Autoencoders (VAAE) for effective sequence modeling
- Reduces negative transfer through mutual information minimization
- Outperforms existing approaches in both course-level and student-level CDKT scenarios

## Key Features

- üß† **Disentangled Representation Learning**: Separates transferable knowledge from domain-specific patterns
- ‚è≥ **Temporal Modeling**: Combines VAE with hierarchical attention for effective sequence modeling
- üîÑ **Cross-Domain Transfer**: Supports knowledge transfer across multiple educational domains
- üìä **Interpretable Results**: Provides visualizations of knowledge state evolution

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DisenKT.git
cd DisenKT
pip install -r requirements.txt
